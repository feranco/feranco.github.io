<p class="message">
I'm a SW Engineer with a solid professional background in the overall SW life-cycle and with deep knowledge of real-time, safety critical and embedded systems. I'm currently working in the Business R&D Department of <a href="http://new.abb.com" class="noborder">my link</a> [ABB] (http://new.abb.com). I'm really passionate about coding, algorithms and technology. I've also a significant research experience in computer vision, image processing and machine learning. I defended my PhD thesis on “Local Surface Pose Estimation from a Scale Invariant Keypoint” in April 2013. I received both my BSc (2006) and MSc (2008) degrees in Computer Engineering from University of Florence. Further I spent seven years working in the industry for General Electric in Florence, Italy and Bombardier Transportation in Zurich, Switzerland.
