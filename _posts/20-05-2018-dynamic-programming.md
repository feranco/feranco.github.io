Dynamic programming is a method that solves problems by combining the solutions to subproblems. In particular, dynamic programming applies when the subproblems overlap. A dynamic-programming algorithm solves each subsubproblem just once and then saves its answer in a table, thereby avoiding the work of recomputing the answer every time it solves each subsubproblem. (“Programming” in this context refers to a tabular method, not to writing computer code.)
