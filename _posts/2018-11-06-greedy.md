Algorithms for optimization problems typically go through a sequence of steps, with a set of choices at each step. As discussed in a previous post about [DP](2018-05-20-dynamic-programming.md), a dynamic programming approach examines each choice only once avoiding repeated computations. For some problems checking all possible choices could be not necessary and a more efficient algorithm could be applied. A greedy algorithm is an algorithm that makes at each step the choice that is locally optimum and it never changes this choice.
So a greedy algorithm produces an optimum solution only when all locally optimal choices lead to a globally optimal solution. We start by thinking about a
dynamic-programming solution, in which we consider several choices when determining
which subproblems to use in an optimal solution. We shall then observe that
we need to consider only one choice—the greedy choice—and that when we make
the greedy choice, only one subproblem remains. Based on these observations, we
shall develop a recursive greedy algorithm to solve the activity-scheduling problem.
We shall complete the process of developing a greedy solution by converting
the recursive algorithm to an iterative one
