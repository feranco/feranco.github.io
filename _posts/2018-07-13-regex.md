##Metacharacters

* ^ match the beginning of a line; ^dog match tha beginning of a line followed by dog
* $ match the end of a line ; ^dog$ match the beginning of a line followed by dog followed by the end of the line; $^match an empty line
* [ ] match any character listed in the class; it is possible to specify intervals of characters using the dash '-'; [0-3a-c] has the same behavior of [0123abc]; the dash
  is a metacharacter within a character class, so to include the dash as character inside the class it is necessary to specify it immediately after the [; 12[-./]11[-./]1981
  match my birthday in the most common formats; [0-9] match any digit (\d or [:digit:] in ECMA flavor)
* [^ ] match any character not listed in the class; the caret ^ is a metacharacter within a character class, so to include the caret  as character inside the class
  it is necessary to specify it not immediately after the [; 'q[^u]' match any word having a q followed by any character that is not u, but doesn't match a q that is at
  the end of a line (even if negated, a character class requires a character to match;  [^0-9] match any character except digits (\D or [^:digit:] in ECMA flavor)
* . match any character; can be escaped with \.
* | match either the subexpression on the left or the subexpression on the right (in this context subexpression means any regular expression), the () parenthesis can be used to limit the alternation to their content; '^(From|Subject|Date +):' match the beginning of a line followed by From or Subject or Date, followed by :

##Options

* ignoring capitalizaation: -i in egrep; regex_constants::icase in c++11

Call std::regex_search() with your subject string as the first parameter and the regex object as the second parameter 
to check whether your regex can match any part of the string.  

Call std::regex_match() with the same parameters if you want to check whether your regex can match the entire subject string. The regex_match algorithm in C++11 will return true only if the target string match exactly the regular expression
