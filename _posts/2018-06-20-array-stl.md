"initialize all elements to T{}". That's not default-initialization, it is value-initialization (8.5/7). You can request value initialization quite easily in C++11 by giving each declaration an empty initializer:

int plain_int{};
int c_style_array[13]{};
std::array<int, 13> cxx_style_array{};
Which will value-initialize all of the array elements in turn, resulting in plain_old_int, and all the members of both kinds of arrays, being initialized to zero.
