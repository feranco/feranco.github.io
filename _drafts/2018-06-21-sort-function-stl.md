The sort() function declared in <algorithm> can be a very useful tool to sort primitive arrays or containers supporting random-access iterators like std::array, std::vectors and std::deque. The function has the following prototypes: 
  
% highlight cpp %  
  template <class RandomAccessIterator>
  void sort ( RandomAccessIterator first, RandomAccessIterator last );

  template <class RandomAccessIterator, class Compare>
  void sort ( RandomAccessIterator first, RandomAccessIterator last, Compare comp );
% endhighlight %  

The first two parameters define the range to sort as [first,Last) meaning that it includes the element pointed by the first but it doesnâ€™t include the element pointed by last. The third parameter is optional and it is used to customize how the sort is performed. 

It is a function taking two elements in the range as arguments and returning a value convertible to bool that indicates whether the element passed as first argument is considered to preceed the second in the specific strict weak ordering it defines.
