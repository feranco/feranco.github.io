# Problem definition

Given a set of items with values and weights, put these items in a knapsack having maximum weight equal to W in order to maximize the value of the items in the knapsack. The sum of the weights of the items in the knapsack can be less than or equal to W.

# Understand the problem

An item can be represented as an instance of a class with integer member variables defining its weight and its value. The goal is to define a subset of items maximizing their value without exceeding the knapsack capacity (i.e. its maximum weight). Also this 

```cpp
using std::vector;
using uint = unsigned int;

struct Item {
  uint weight;
  uint value;
};

struct Result {
  vector<uint> items;
  uint value;
};
```

# Brute force solution
Brute force:
a. Find all combinations of items
b. Filter out all combinations that exceed weight
c. Of the filtered combinations, find the one with the greatest value

```cpp
Result Knapsack01 (const vector<Item>& items, size_t capacity, size_t currentWeight, size_t currentValue, size_t idx) {
  
  if (currentWeight > capacity) return Result({},0); 
  
  if (idx == items.size()) return Result({}, currentValue); 
  
  Result without = Knapsack01(items, capacity, currentWeight, currentValue, idx+1);
  Result with = Knapsack01(items, capacity, currentWeight+items[idx].weight, currentValue+items[idx].value, idx+1);
  with.items.push_back(items[idx]);
  return (without.value() > with.value()) ? without : with;
  
}
```
