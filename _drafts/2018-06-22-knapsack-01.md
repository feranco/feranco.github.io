# Problem definition

Given a set of items with values and weights, put these items in a knapsack having maximum weight equal to W in order to maximize the value of the items in the knapsack. The sum of the weights of the items in the knapsack can be less than or equal to W.

# Understand the problem

An item can be represented as an instance of a class with integer member variables defining its weight and its value. The goal is to define a subset of items maximizing their value without exceeding the knapsack capacity (i.e. its maximum weight). Also this 

```cpp
using std::vector;
using uint = unsigned int;

struct Item {
  uint weight;
  uint value;
};

struct Result {
  vector<uint> items;
  uint value;
};
```

# Brute force solution

The brute force solution can be summarized with the following steps:
* find all the possible combinations of items;
* filter out all the combinations with a weight exceeding the knapsack capacity;
* among the filtered combinations, find the one with the maximum value.

```cpp
vector<Item> knapsack01 (const vector<Item>& items, uint capacity) {
  vector<vector<Item>> combinations = findCombinations(items);
  vector<Item> knapsack;
  uint maxValue = 0;
  
  for (const auto& combination : combinations) {
    uint value = 0, weight = 0;
    for_each (combination.begin(), combination.end(), [&](const auto& c){
      value += c.value;
      weight += c.weight;
    });
    if (weight <= capacity) {
      maxValue = max(maxValue, value);
      knapsack = combination;
    }
    return knapsack;
  }
  
  
  
}

```

```cpp
Result Knapsack01 (const vector<Item>& items, size_t capacity, size_t currentWeight, size_t currentValue, size_t idx) {
  
  if (currentWeight > capacity) return Result({},0); 
  
  if (idx == items.size()) return Result({}, currentValue); 
  
  Result without = Knapsack01(items, capacity, currentWeight, currentValue, idx+1);
  Result with = Knapsack01(items, capacity, currentWeight+items[idx].weight, currentValue+items[idx].value, idx+1);
  with.items.push_back(items[idx]);
  return (without.value() > with.value()) ? without : with;
  
}
```
