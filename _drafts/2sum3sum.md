2Sum, 3Sum and 4Sum are popular coding interview questions. Each one of themhas several variations that looks more complicated, but have the same complexity as the basic form in the end. Let's start with the basic 2Sum question that will be the basic building block for all the other problems..

## 2Sum

Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that theyadd up to a specific target. You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
